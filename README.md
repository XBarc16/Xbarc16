## About
Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Xavier!
I'm delighted you stopped by to learn a bit more about me.

Originally from France, Iâ€™m currently soaking in the vibrant culture of Houston, Texas, where Iâ€™ve found a wonderful blend of Southern charm and diverse communities.

My journey into the world of data began with my Bachelor's degree in Sociology, a field that has given me invaluable insights into the social implications behind data trends. I am truly passionate about using my skills to empower organizations to leverage data effectively, driving positive social change and informed policy-making. Through my studies, I honed strong research competencies, including survey design, data collection, and statistical analysisâ€”essential tools for comprehensive data analysis and understanding.
Eager to make a meaningful impact, I thrive on contributing my expertise to projects that can change society for the better.

With a diverse professional background spanning leadership roles in hospitality management, emergency services, and real estate, I bring not only solid problem-solving abilities but also exceptional communication skills, all while maintaining composure in high-pressure environments. Being multilingual in English, French, Italian, and Spanish allows me to engage with diverse perspectives and enhances my ability to drive data-driven decision-making in collaborative team settings.

Currently, I enjoy creating my own datasets for analysis, exploring tools like Tableau, and delving into the fascinating realms of APIs and machine learning. Iâ€™m always on the lookout for opportunities to broaden my knowledge and enhance my skills.

When I'm not diving into data, you'll often find me lacing up my running shoes, engaged in a thrilling pickup soccer match, or experimenting in the kitchen as I whip up culinary delights. A bit of a movie and TV show buff, I love to immerse myself in captivating stories, often with a draft of my own when I find a free moment to jot down ideas.
